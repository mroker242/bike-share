# Bike Share

In the bike share project, data were analyzed from 3 major US cities by the company [Motivate](https://https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share company. Two types of customers (subscribers and customers) were analyzed along with other factors such as time of day, day of week, and age.

It was found that certain factors influenced the rider usage more than others, including time of year and ages.
